# If you have 6 elevators in a 25 story building, how would you go about
# programming them?

# Thinking in terms of the metaphor we talked about yesterday, where we have
# the elevator's computer and the elevator, weâ€™d want to make a class for each:

# Create 6 elevators, each on a random floor (somewhere between the
# first and 25th floor, inclusively) and each moving up or down, or standing.
elevators = []
states = ["up", "down", "standing"]

  elevators << Elevator.new(states.sample, rand(1..25))
end

# For an actual elevator program, this information would be calculated as people
# push the up or down buttons on each floor, but as we only have one command
# line, not 25, we'll have to settle for getting this information up front.
